              <p>
                Hello, my name is Xushnudbek. I was born in 2000 in Bukhara
                region.
                <br />
                After graduating from high school, I studied at Vobkent
                Construction and Vocational College. Finally, in 2019, I entered
                Tashkent University of Information Technologies. After that, my
                programming life began.

              <h1>My Way of programming</h1>
              <p>
                I became interested in programming after I entered the
                university. And I have been doing it regularly. During this
                time, I completed the courses of several world-famous teachers
                (Mosh Hamadani, Kent C. Dodds, Jonas Schmedtmann). And these
                courses made me Frontend programming made a great contribution
                to my education in the field.
